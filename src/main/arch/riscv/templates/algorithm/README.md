Algorithm Test Templates
=============================

### About

This folder contains test templates that describe simple algorithms applied to random data.
These templates demonstrate the ability of MicroTESK to simulate execution of generated instruction
sequences.

### Running Test Generation

To generate test programs for all test templates, run the following command:

    make

To generate test programs for specific test templates, pass their names to the make command.
