# Description:
#
# This test template demonstrates how MicroTESK can simulate the execution
# of a test program to predict the resulting state of a microprocessor
# design under test. The described program calculates the quotient and
# the remainder of division of two random numbers by using
# the simple algorithm of repeated subtraction.
