Debug Test Templates
====================

### About

This folder contains test templates that help perform basic validation of instruction
implementation. They were developed mainly to check the validity of RISC-V formal specifications
used by MicroTESK. Also, some of them can be useful as examples.

### Running Test Generation

To generate test programs for all test templates, run the following command:

```
$ make
```
