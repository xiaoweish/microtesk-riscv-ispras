Test Templates for RISC-V Tests
=============================

### About

This folder contains test templates that were created by porting the RISC-V test suite
(https://github.com/riscv/riscv-tests) into the MicroTESK template description language.
They are used to validate RISC-V ISA specifications used by MicroTESK.
Also, they can serve as a basis for creating more complex tests.
