# Description:
#
# This test template demonstrates how to use the 'sequence' construct that which describes
# trivial instruction sequences.

class SequenceTemplate < RiscVBaseTemplate

  def run
    # The 'sequence' block describes a trivial (plain) instruction sequence.
    # In the example below, the instructions use random registers and random values.
    sequence {
      add  x(_), x(_), x(_)
      sub  x(_), x(_), x(_)
      And  x(_), x(_), x(_)
      Or   x(_), x(_), x(_)
      Xor  x(_), x(_), x(_)

      xori x(_), x(_), _
      ori  x(_), x(_), _
      andi x(_), x(_), _
    }.run

    # It is possible to generate multiple sequences from the same description.
    # This can be done by passing the number of sequences to the 'run' method.
    # In this case, registers and input values will be selected individually for each sequence.
    sequence {
      add  x(_), x(_), x(_)
      sub  x(_), x(_), x(_)

      andi x(_), x(_), _
    }.run 3 # Gives 3 similar sequences.

    # A sequence can be shuffled to make instruction appear in a random order.
    # This can be done by using a component called 'obfuscator'.
    # To apply it, a corresponding attribute needs to be specified.
    # When multiple sequences are generated, randomization is applied individually
    # to each of the sequences.
